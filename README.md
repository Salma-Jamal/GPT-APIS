Integrate different GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models into applications.

- GPT models are deep learning algorithms that are trained on large amounts of data to generate natural language text.

- GPT APIs provide an easy way for developers to leverage this technology in their own applications, without having to build and train their own models from scratch.

- Several GPT APIs available, including:
  - OpenAI.
  - Hugging Face.
  - Google.
  
- These APIs provide a range of capabilities:
    - Simple text generation.
    - Summarization.
    - Translation
